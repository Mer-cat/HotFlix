# Project 2 - *HotFlix*

**HotFlix** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **~17** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User can tap a cell to see a detail view (backdrop image, poster image, title, release date, overview)
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to better structure the code such that code does not need to be repeated/copied and pasted across many view controllers
2. Better ways to implement scroll views

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

I had issues with the app crashing due to null posters or backdrops, so I started checking them, but I ran into issues with different types of null (e.g. [NSNull null] versus nil, etc.). I am still curious about these different kinds of null - I would not have known which kind to check for if I didn't use a breakpoint to figure it out.

I also had issues with the UIScrollView functionality; I couldn't actually scroll down to view long descriptions because the UI would bounce me back up if I attempted to do so.
